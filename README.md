this is a rookie bruteforce script that ive made to bunk my cho-102 tutorial classes, this bruteforces to get me the password of the protected pdf.


takes a lot of time tho, will operate on that later this is an interesting project, will be taking this further. really inspired by ilovepdf's speed in doing this. their api did it in seconds for me and is what i currently use for stuff like this, this script takes hours and hours to get the ans and would absolutely be annihlated if i added capital characters numbers and special characters to the sample space. would love to make my project as fast as theirs. may have to dive into c/c++ for that but we'll see.


to run:

1. cd into the repo
2. update any variables if needed
3. add the path to the pdf
4. node index.js
